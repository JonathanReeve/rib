# Rib

[Rib](https://github.com/srid/rib) is a Haskell **static site generator** based
on Shake, with a delightful development experience.

**UPDATE (Apr, 2021)**: Rib is superceded by [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/)

## Features

Rib composes existing tools designed to do their task well, instead of
reinventing their capabilities. Time spent using rib is time spent learning them.

- Use [Shake](https://shakebuild.com/) as the core build engine.
- Write HTML & CSS in Haskell with natural flow (using [Lucid](https://chrisdone.com/posts/lucid2/) &
  [Clay](http://fvisser.nl/clay/))
  - Optional route system for type-safe construction of your site routes.
- Parse Markdown and other formats supported by
  [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) / [MMark](https://github.com/mmark-md/mmark).
- Remain as simple as possible to use
- Reproducible and a delightful workflow enabled by Nix, ghcid and fsnotify.

See [[[preview]]] to get a feel for what your code may look like.
